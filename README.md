#  Checker-Tron

## what this project is
a simple (not yet working) checkers application 

## how to run it
Clone this repo, in terminal navigate to the checker-tron directory and run 'node index.js'

## how to run the test suite
Tests will be implemented as soon as I learn how to use Jest

## how to make moves
The plan is to click on the piece you want to move, then click on the space you want to move it to.

## notes on implementation strategy

## TODO
- Game logic
- render moves
- make fetch request for game state
- make the state
